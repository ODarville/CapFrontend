# Thats Cap
Backend: https://github.com/ODarville/CapBackend

##Notes
Wow this is amazing, while I am still a young dev in terms of starting. Getting here to this point in my developing career is a achievement but this is the beginning.
While at the time of diplaying this to my classmates, this project is not where I want it to be. This project will be sometime in the future though. I am excited from
what I learn, how I learned, and to the connections that have been built. So now lets get into it!

Also shout out firstly to the Goat Bryan Santos!

##Description
