##Notes
Wow this is amazing, while I am still a young dev in terms of starting. Getting here to this point in my developing career is a achievement but this is the beginning.
While at the time of diplaying this to my classmates, this project is not where I want it to be,  it is extremely unfished at this point in time and for that I apologize. This project will be sometime in the future though. I am excited from
what I learn, how I learned, and to the connections that have been built. So now lets get into it!

Shout out firstly to the Goat Bryan Santos!
Next the Avengers we have here Captain Dayton(Naomi), Spider-X(Xavier), and Zooooooooo(The Animal)

##Description
Thats Cap is a simple app that connects you with the resteurant shops in the plaza. You can write reviews for that plaza as well as directly go to that shops website from
this plaza app! Unfortunately I was not able to add any styling to this app at all, I achieved functionality and that is as far as I got.
